# The image is built ONCE with a `/__BASE__/` placeholder base (see
# vite.config.ts). At container start — before nginx boots — the
# nginx-unprivileged image runs every /docker-entrypoint.d/*.sh as UID
# 101. This script:
#   1. Copies the staged build (/app) into the html root under the
#      requested BASE_PATH sub-path.
#   2. Rewrites `/__BASE__/` -> the real BASE_PATH in the copied files.
#   3. Generates the nginx server block for that base.
#
# BASE_PATH="/"        -> mounted at site root (standalone)
# BASE_PATH="/katalog/"-> mounted at /katalog/ (the demo path-route)
